# GAN-Based Nude Generator - Major Update

## 🚀 Complete Rebuild with GAN Technology

This is a **major update** that completely replaces the previous Stable Diffusion approach with a proper **GAN-based implementation** for realistic nude image generation.

## ❌ Previous Issues (Stable Diffusion Approach)

The previous implementation had significant problems:
- Poor quality output (basic color overlays)
- No realistic skin textures
- Incorrect body proportions
- No anatomical accuracy
- Dependency on heavy diffusion models

## ✅ New GAN Solution

### Architecture: Pix2Pix Conditional GAN

**Generator**: U-Net with skip connections
- Encoder-decoder architecture
- Skip connections preserve fine details
- 8 downsampling + 8 upsampling layers
- Instance normalization for stable training

**Discriminator**: PatchGAN
- Classifies 70x70 patches as real/fake
- More efficient than full-image discrimination
- Better preservation of local details

### Key Improvements

1. **Realistic Output**
   - Proper skin textures and tones
   - Anatomically correct body shapes
   - Consistent lighting and shadows
   - High-resolution results (256x256+)

2. **Advanced Training**
   - Adversarial loss for realism
   - L1 pixel-wise loss for accuracy
   - Progressive training support
   - Batch processing capabilities

3. **Production Ready**
   - Modular architecture
   - CLI interface
   - Batch processing
   - Model saving/loading
   - Comprehensive testing
